# odin-recipes
In this project, I will be using basic HTML text, hyperlinks, and images to create a recipe website. To acheive this, I will create a home page with relative links to various dishes and list the ingredients as a list. I will be using headers, text modifiers, and inserting images to create a more user-friendly experience.
